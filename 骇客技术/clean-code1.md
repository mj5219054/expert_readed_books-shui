 # 文艺黑客松开幕式上的致辞
 **致敬先驱**
 * 早上起床的时候我很焦虑。面对一群黑客，我能说点儿什么呢？对我这样最低级的网络用户而言，黑客是些很神秘的网络飞侠。作为一个艺术人，我也曾经有过一些“涉黑”的念头。时间关系，这里只举两个例子，看诸位是否能够帮我实现。Google Earth刚发布的那段时间，我极为着迷，整天盯着屏幕，在Google Earth上游荡。突然有一天我产生了一种冲动——“黑掉”或者更文明的说法“骇进”（感谢姚大钧或是马楠的翻译）Google 一分钟，让Google Earth在这一分钟成为我的个展。这是比把MoMA网站变成个人网站更加棒的事情。我给这个计划取了个名字，叫《世界观》。

 * 另一个想法：我们所处的每一座城市里都有无数的摄像头，这些摄像头每时每刻都记录下这个城市以及所有人的生命景观。这产生了一个巨大的影像数据库，而且这简直就是一个多角度、多层次、多频道的巨型“空间影像”装置。我们是否可能将这个隐形数据库、这个巨型装置激活？从中提取出无数人在过去几年中的生命轨迹，以他们的时间轨迹和空间轨迹，构造起他们动态的数码纪念碑。我想，这会是一种交响乐式的宏大的生命景观。

* 2014年上海双年展的策展人弗兰克［Anselm Frank］根据当年加州很著名的《全球图录》［The Whole Earth Catalogue］做了个展览。从那本《全球图录》中他最受启发的，是1960年代加州文化孕育的两种希望改变整个世界的力量的不同命运，这两种力量，一个是所谓“新左派”，另一个是计算机技术。前者失败了，运动者们纷纷当上教授，后者的核心是最早的一批“黑客”，他们不但缔造了IT行业，而且建立了改变人类生活的网络世界。但是，他们真的成功了吗？正如刘慈欣所说：

 IT技术把我们变成一种“宅”在家里的文明，人们乐于享受科技的便利服务，却丧失了向外探索无穷未知领域的狂热。

* 1999年，在座的大多数黑客朋友当时还没有上小学，沃卓斯基兄弟导演了一部风靡全球的电影Matrix，我们中文世界译为《黑客帝国》或者《骇客帝国》。这就跟诸位有关了。Matrix上映之后，立即引起了一场席卷全球的传媒风暴。所有媒体所关注的，不但是其眩目的视觉特技和奇特的想象，而且不约而同地对片中遍布全局的玄学隐喻猜测不休。几乎所有谈论Matrix的评论或者新闻报道，在津津乐道于它眩目的视觉效果之后，总要加上一个哲学的尾巴，以示思想深刻。这些评论津津乐道于片名Matrix既有计算机科学中“矩阵”的意思，也有繁衍万物的“子宫”、“母体”之义；女一号的名字Trinity意为“圣三位一体”；男一号尼奥的原名叫“安德森”［Anderson］，即“人之子”，从Matrix觉醒之后改名为尼奥［Neo］是“新”的意思，而字母的重新组合便是“The One”（救世主）；尼奥的导引者“墨菲斯”［Morpheus］，即希腊神话中掌管睡眠和梦幻的神，等等。电影在法国上映的半个月后，即1999年6月22日，法国蓬皮杜文化中心的文学沙龙就召开了一次圆桌会议，中心议题就是《黑客帝国》的哲学：“真实的荒漠”——在电影里，墨菲斯带着尼奥参观现实的废墟时说：“欢迎来到真实的荒漠。”

 * 当然，这部好莱坞电影的哲学也是好莱坞式的，在质量和深度上基本是卡拉OK的水平，就像我对网络和技术的理解力一样。然而有趣的是，在影片的叙述中，Matrix的世界连同抵抗者、觉醒者所拯救捍卫的现实也同样都是Matrix的创造——那个让人绝望的“真实的荒漠”也只不过是又一重Matrix而已。

然而，Matrix究竟是什么？当然，它既是“矩阵”，也是“母体”；既是陌生冷漠的数字模态，又是孕育我们的子宫；是生存的地平线和囚笼，是生活世界的创造者，也是生活这个谎言的制造者；是父，是主人，也是魔鬼和最邪恶的敌人。但是，在成为这一切之前，它首先是一个虚拟的符号性秩序，一个为我们构建现实的数字网络。Matrix不仅仅控制主体的行动和意志，它连主体的感觉和世界都一起控制了。Matrix将主体和其所生存的生活世界一起构造出来。于是，Matrix就是世界，就是现实。

在这个世界中，作为“人之子”或者“救世主”、“新生”或者“一”的安德森／尼奥出生、成长、受教育、恋爱、工作……是个正常的上班族（跟《楚门的世界》中的Truman一样），唯一异常的，他还是个小小的黑客，通过网络赚点外快。然而，这一切都不重要。重要的是，他感到困惑。如果他没有遇到墨菲斯（他的施洗约翰），他将带着这种困惑一直生活下去，直至衰老、死去。

 ** “这就是你一生中都会体验到的感觉。感觉到这世界出了什么问题。你不知道问题是什么，但知道它在那里，就像在你脑中有一个碎片，搞得你快发狂了……到处都有Matrix，它无时无处不包围着我们，甚至在这里，这个房间里……是这个世界蒙蔽了你的双眼，让你看不见真相。”

“什么是真相？”

“真相是你是一个奴隶，尼奥。你，和其他所有人一样，生来受奴役……你给关在一所监狱里，这监狱你无法闻及，无法品尝，无法触摸。这是你头脑的监狱。”

尼奥的困惑在于，这个世界“不对劲”，或者说，这世界不如人意。在Matrix第一部的结尾，Matrix的代言人史密斯先生向尼奥讲述了Matrix的诞生过程：

“你知道第一个Matrix是要被设计成一个完美的人类世界吗？在那里，没有人遭受痛苦，每个人都十分快乐？但那是个灾难。没有人会接受这种程序。整个成果失败了。一些人认为我们没有设计这种向你描绘完美世界的程序语言的能力。但我相信我们有，作为一个生物种类，人类将他们的现实定义为经历着痛苦和不幸的现实。”

一个完美的世界是不被接受的，因为那是个灾难——在乌托邦中，乌托邦将不复存在，所有人的幸福将不再是幸福。那种“被完美设计”的恐惧感，自赫胥黎的《美丽新世界》以来一直深植在我们理智的大脑深处。

墨菲斯引导尼奥将他的困惑和怀疑扩展到自我和整个世界。而对生活在这个虚假现实中的尼奥来说，他的经验首先是一种身不由及的感觉，这是一种自我的“不自在”，主体从来不能完全支配自己的行为效果，也就是说，主体所有行动的结果总是偏离于他的期望和目标。意志与结果总是偏离，我们总是达不到预期的和想要的。对于这种类似“无常”的经验，我们每个人都感同身受，但我们却不像尼奥那样困惑。因为偶然性、命运、因缘甚至社会实体、他人意志这些观念，都可以成为这种感受的责任人和施动者。一切令人困惑或者不满的现实，都可以说是“造化弄人”，或者都可以归结为“极少数一小撮人”的背后操作。人本质上不能承受无常的现实，所以在现实背后追加了一个真相，一个施动者、责任人。无产阶级的苦难是由于资产阶级的剥削，《1984》中大洋国的老百姓没有面包是因为欧亚国或东亚国始终在掐脖子，生产力下降是因为老大哥的敌对势力在蓄意破坏——反正你所看到所感到的都不是现实，现实别有真相。山重水复，柳暗花明，真相一定存在，最终一定可以解释所有的一切。在此，我们可以看到，这种关于真相的说法竟然吻合着社会阴谋论［conspiracy theories］的基本结构。作为真相的施动者是现实的他者，因为我们都在现实之内身不由己，只有置身其外的他者才能够安排这一切。所以，现实－假象背后必定还有另外一个实在的现实。

在Matrix中，尼奥的伟大和超能力在于：他可以看清我们日常现实不是真实，而不过是被数字编码的虚拟世界，因此他也就成了能从中抽身的人，可以操纵和超越虚拟世界的规则（比如在空中飞，能阻止子弹……）。他至关重要的功能，在于能将“现实”虚拟化（或者相反，将虚拟的一切现实化），也就是透过现象看本质：现实是一个仿像结构，它的规则可以中断，可以重写，于是，作为救世主的尼奥也就是一个重返柏拉图洞穴的囚徒，可以抵御、看破作为“现实”的影像，认识并且体验到——现实不存在。尼奥赤身裸体地从现实世界的“下水道”中滑出来，经历再生的过程，并再次进入Matrix寻找神谕，当他等候先知传见时，尼奥看见一个天才小孩用他的意志力将勺子弄弯，小孩告诉他：能这么做的关键，不是要说服自己我能将勺子弄弯，而是要说服自己勺子根本就不存在……

但是，岂不正是这本来并不存在的勺子引导我们穿越现实的领域？勺子及其不存在共同构成了一个真相，那正是Matrix所掩盖的，仅此而已，没有其他。简单地说，真相并不是勺子背后还有一个实在，the real reality就是，勺子背后一无所有。

Matrix I最后，尼奥看破幻象，宣告了解放之途。Matrix系统开始失灵，同时，尼奥作为救世主教导那些仍然陷身于Matrix／柏拉图洞穴中的人们如何从Matrix的约束中解放自身——他们可以打破自然法则，可以弄弯金属，可以在空中飞行……但问题在于，所有这些“奇迹”，只有当且仅当我们仍处身于由Matrix控制的虚拟现实中时才是可能的。导演过于低估了Matrix的作用，它不仅仅是遮蔽现实的幻像，一个不存在的假象，事实上，它是现实的对应物，是现实得以实现的操作机制。在这里，我们或许面对着一种中间状态：Matrix并不是贝克莱的精神中创造并且支撑着世界的上帝，也不是怀疑论者认为的试图掩盖虚无之真相的撒旦。毋宁说：Matrix是表象和现实之间的一个中介，一个保证两者协调的中间人。

如果Matrix只是表象－世界的一个协调机制，那么我们的现实其实就是虚拟现实，生活世界就只是一个显示器。但是，为什么我们总是认为有一个不可见的暗箱世界在决定着可见的－显示出的现实？我们何以需要建立另一个想象的“真相”来补充现实？

在影片的开头，Matrix中的上班族－网络黑客安德森（觉醒之前的尼奥）从书架上抽出一本书，把刚刚收到的黑钱夹到书里。那本书的标题是《仿像与模拟》，是法国哲学家让·鲍德里亚关于虚拟技术对人类影响的力作，而他翻到的那一章“恰巧”叫做《虚无主义》。当然，我们知道，“虚无”不可能如此轻佻地成为化解资本的路径，正如尼奥的敌人，打不死的史密斯先生不能被简单地视作Matrix的化身。史密斯在Matrix中可以是每一个人、任何人和所有人，他化身亿万，无所不至，简直就像三千大千世界中示现自身的观世音菩萨。在影片最后，我们会悲哀地发现：所谓真实的荒漠、自由的世界、抵抗者的家园，都不过是又一重Matrix；救世者尼奥不过是Matrix自我检测系统设置的一个病毒，而史密斯则是一个不断升级的杀毒软件。

尼奥是1，那么谁是0呢？是尼奥的配角，自由世界的叛徒塞佛［Cypher］。Cypher是零，是密码，也是翻译，他跟尼奥共同构成了这个0和1的世界。面对Matrix的代理人史密斯，塞佛做出了最后的选择，当时史密斯正请他在虚拟世界吃牛排。他说：“这块牛排，我知道它并不存在，但是Matrix发送信息，让我感受到它的鲜嫩和美味……”塞佛微笑着把牛排放入口中。

希望上面说的这些对诸位接下去两天的工作有些帮助。最后，我有一个提醒。这第一场黑客松叫做“落地松”，我们都知道，做创新的人最珍惜的是头脑风暴的畅想时光，那是思想的子弹自由飞翔的时刻，一旦落地，就很容易进入例行模式，被各种行业套路牵引。尽管“骇进”［Hacking］工作比较特殊，思想和创意往往都是从落地的具体问题开始，但这次我们是一次文艺黑客松，很可能是华人社会的第一次，是由艺术家和程序员联合组成的骇进共同体，情况会有所不同。骇进现实，不只是拆解、搅乱，更重要的是如何去置换这个世界的根本结构？简单地说，我们要充分考虑到，一旦落地，如何生根？

** 在“落地”之前，让思想的子弹飞久一点儿。**
 # 《黑客-计算机革命的英雄》笔记起源自麻省理工MIT的那种黑客文化，对技术的追求，对于计算机技术的热爱，对解决问题的完美方法的不断探索，他们用自己的激情和汗水去不断挑战技术的极限。

* 1、 黑客伦理 1）对计算机的访问（以及任何可能帮助你认识我们这个世界的事物）应该是不受限制的、完全的。任何人都有动手尝试的权利！

* 2）所有的信息都应该可以自由获取。 

* 3）不迷信权威-促进分权。 

* 4）评判黑客的标准应该是他们的技术，而不是那些没有实际用途的指标，比如学位、年龄、种族或职位。 

* 5）你可以在计算机上创造艺术和美。

*  6）计算机技术可以让你的生活更美好。 2、 在朴实无华的外表之下，他们是真正的冒险家、梦想者、勇于承担风险的人和艺术家……而且他们显然清楚地认识到了为什么计算机是一种真正的革命性工具。他们对黑客思想的追求是永无止境的。真正的黑客把“黑客”一词视为无上的荣耀，而不是贬损。 3、 只有搞清楚东西是如何工作的，才能理解它的意义。 4、 “懂硬件”就像是理解了物理性质的精髓一样。 5、 没有程序是完美的，但这并不会阻止黑客对完美的追求。 

*  6、 不那么值得信任的武器或工具是不会被珍视的。 

*  7、 将编程技术提升至艺术级。 

*  8、 假如你就试了几次后便放弃了，你就永远解决不了这个问题…….世界上的很多问题，只要你有其他人两倍或者三倍的努力就一定能解决。

*   9、 他再一次用事实而不是通过展现组织管理的能力证明，在溜门撬锁这一神圣的黑色艺术领域里，他也是一位王者。
* 
*   10、 一般而言，黑客伦理是指黑客必须追求专门的知识和技能，并且与社区分享这些知识和技能。 

*  11、 我们心里清楚，我们应该抓住机会做些自己认为该做的事情。 
  
*  12、 殚精竭虑，不仅要完成他的项目，而且还想要干得漂亮。这一点对公司和他的自尊心来说同等重要。 

*    13、 对技术的迷恋可能导致盲目地滥用这种技术。 
    
*    14、 一名真正的程序员，一定要有黑客的精湛技术，要具有非常高超的编程才能。
     
*    15、 我们必须要向那些墨守成规的文化挑战，用我们自身的创造力向它挑战。要并且用我们自己的创造力去取得突破……这才是实质。当然，这就是伦理的实质。 
    
*    16、 黑客从不相信别人所说的无法做到的事情，正是这样的信念指引他们取得了突破性的成就。
    
*     17、 现在的黑客是在黑客主义和商业两种价值观并不对立的环境中成长起来的。他们正影响着黑客运动的未来。 

*     18、 斯图尔特.布兰德：“一方面，信息应该是昂贵的，因为它非常有价值。你在正确的地方得到正确的信息，就会改变你的人生。另一方面，信息应该是免费的，因为获得信息的成本不断地降低。这就是两者的矛盾。”所以，“所有的信息都应该可以自由地获取”，并不是说像免费啤酒一样，而是指的一种自由。
*    19、 Facebook每6—8周就会举行一次“黑客马拉松”（hackathons），人们用一晚上的时间设计并完成一个项目。扎克伯格说：“我们坚持的理念就是快速发展，突破障碍，做出承诺后就努力去实现。”

*    20、 成为下一次革命的英雄。
 Hackish speech generally features extremely precise diction, careful word choice, a relatively large working vocabulary, and relatively little use of contractions or street slang. Dry humor, irony, puns, and a mildly flippant attitude are highly valued — but an underlying seriousness and intelligence are essential. One should use just enough jargon to communicate precisely and identify oneself as a member of the culture; overuse of jargon or a breathless, excessively gung-ho attitude is considered tacky and the mark of a loser.

 This speech style is a variety of the precisionist English normally spoken by scientists, design engineers, and academics in technical fields. In contrast with the methods of jargon construction, it is fairly constant throughout hackerdom.

It has been observed that many hackers are confused by negative questions — or, at least, that the people to whom they are talking are often confused by the sense of their answers. The problem is that they have done so much programming that distinguishes between

if (going) ...

and

if (!going) ...

that when they parse the question “Aren't you going?” it may seem to be asking the opposite question from “Are you going?”, and so to merit an answer in the opposite sense. This confuses English-speaking non-hackers because they were taught to answer as though the negative part weren't there. In some other languages (including Russian, Chinese, and Japanese) the hackish interpretation is standard and the problem wouldn't arise. Hackers often find themselves wishing for a word like French ‘si’, German ‘doch’, or Dutch ‘jawel’ — a word with which one could unambiguously answer ‘yes’ to a negative question. (See also mu)

For similar reasons, English-speaking hackers almost never use double negatives, even if they live in a region where colloquial usage allows them. The thought of uttering something that logically ought to be an affirmative knowing it will be misparsed as a negative tends to disturb them.

In a related vein, hackers sometimes make a game of answering questions containing logical connectives with a strictly literal rather than colloquial interpretation. A non-hacker who is indelicate enough to ask a question like “So, are you working on finding that bug now or leaving it until later?” is likely to get the perfectly correct answer “Yes!” (that is, “Yes, I'm doing it either now or later, and you didn't ask which!”).

每一位黑客的圈内头衔（Handle）、主要成就（Claim to fame）、第一次接触计算机（First encountered a computer）、自己独特的工具（Unusual tools）、鲜为人知的事实（Little-known fact）、目前状况（Current status）等具体情况分别介绍如下（英文，如有爱好者有兴趣愿意全部翻译成中文，则不胜感谢）。随后还详细附录了黑客守则、黑客简介、黑客发展简史、著名黑客的老窝（个人网站）等中英文重要资料。 


Richard Stallman 

Handle: None (nothing to hide!) 

Claim to fame: A hacker of the old school, Stallman walked in off the street and got a job at MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1971. He was an undergraduate at Harvard at the time. Disturbed that software was viewed as private property, Stallman later founded the Free Software Foundation. 

First encountered a computer: In 1969, at the IBM New York Scientific Center. He was 16 years old. 

Unusual tools: In the 1980s Stallman left MIT’s payroll but continued to work from an office at MIT. Here he created a new operating system called GNU — short for GNU’s Not Unix. 

Little-known fact: Recipient of a $240,000 MacArthur Foundation genius grant. 

Current status: Richard Stallman has just published his latest book, Free Software, Free Society: Selected Essays of Richard M. Stallman, available through GNU Press. 

 

Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson 

Handles: dmr and Ken 

Claim to fame: The driving creative force behind Bell Labs’ legendary computer science operating group, Ritchie and Thompson created UNIX in 1969. An elegant, open operating system for minicomputers, UNIX helped users with general computing, word processing and networking, and soon became a standard language. 

Unusual tools: Plan 9, the next-generation operating system created as the natural descendant of UNIX by Thompson and Bell Labs colleague Rob Pike. 

Little-known fact: Although Ritchie is the author of the popular C programming language, his favorite language is Alef. Thompson, an amateur pilot, once traveled to Moscow to fly a MiG-29. 

Current status: Dennis Ritchie is currently the head of Lucent Technology’s System Software Research Department, while Ken Thompson has retired from both Bell Labs and the hacker spotlight. 


John Draper 

Handle: Cap’n Crunch 

Claim to fame: Figured out how to make free phone calls using a plastic prize whistle he found in a cereal box. Cap’n Crunch introduced generations of hackers to the glorious concept of phone "phreaking." 

First encountered a computer: As a teenager, trying to convince pay phones to return his coin and put through his calls. 

Unusual tools: The toy whistle from boxes of Cap’n Crunch cereal. The whistle reproduced the 2600 hertz tone necessary to authorize a call. Used in conjunction with a bluebox, it allowed users to make free phone calls. (Oscar Meyer weiner whistles also briefly gained a following among phone phreakers.) 

Little-known fact: Honorably discharged from the U.S. Air Force in 1968 after a stint in Vietnam. 

Current status: John Draper has set up his own security firm. He also recently developed Crunchbox, a firewall system that halts the spread of computer viruses. 

Mark Abene 

Handle: Phiber Optik 

Claim to fame: As a founding member of the Masters of Deception, Phiber Optik inspired thousands of teenagers around the country to "study" the internal workings of our nation’s phone system. A federal judge attempted to "send a message" to other hackers by sentencing Phiber to a year in federal prison, but the message got garbled: Hundreds of well-wishers attended a welcome-home party in Abene’s honor at an elite Manhattan Club. Soon after, New York magazine dubbed him one of the city’s 100 smartest people. 

First encountered a computer: Hanging out in the electronics department of the A&S department store in Queens, N.Y., where his mother worked. There he was introduced to the Apple II, the Timex Sinclair and the Commodore 64. The first computer he owned was a Radio Shack TRS-80 (Trash-80). 

Unusual tools: Experimented by dialing patterns on a phone receiver. Abene used the receiver so frequently that it had to be bandaged with black electrical tape to keep its guts from falling out. 

Little-known fact: Phiber Optik’s favorite food: mashed potatoes from Kentucky Fried Chicken. Not real mashed potatoes. Real ones have lumps in them. 

Current status: After doing time in a Pennsylvania prison, Mark Abene worked on penetration tests for an accounting firm, and formed the (now defunct) security company, Crossbar Security 


Robert Morris 

Handle: rtm 

Claim to fame: The son of the chief scientist at the National Computer Security Center — part of the National Security Agency (NSA) — this Cornell University graduate student introduced the word "hacker" into the vernacular when he accidentally unleashed an Internet worm in 1988. Thousands of computers were infected and subsequently crashed. 

First encountered a computer: At home. Morris’ father once brought home one of the original Enigma cryptographic machines from the NSA. It became a household conversation piece. 

Unusual tools: As a teenager Morris had an account on the Bell Labs’ computer network, where early hacking forays gave him super-user status. 

Little-known fact: When the Secret Service raided the home of Legion of Doom member Erik Bloodaxe in 1990, they found a copy of the source code for Morris’ Internet worm. 

Current status: Robert Morris is now an assistant professor at MIT, even though he released his worm virus from there in 1988 (thus disguising the fact that it was actually written at Cornell University). 


Kevin Mitnick 

Handle: Condor 

Claim to fame: The first hacker to have his face immortalized on an FBI "Most Wanted" poster. His status as a repeat offender — a teenage hacker who couldn’t grow up — earned Mitnick the nickname "The Lost Boy of Cyberspace." 

First encountered a computer: As a teenager. Mitnick couldn’t afford a computer, so he hung out in a Radio Shack store. He used the store’s demo models and modem to dial other computers. 

Unusual tools: During the three years he was on the lam, Mitnick used Internet Relay Chat (IRC) as a message drop and to communicate with his friends. 

Little-known fact: Sentenced to a year in a residential treatment center, Mitnick enrolled in a 12-step program to rid himself of what a judge agreed was his "computer addiction." 

Current status: Kevin Mitnick played himself in 2001’s hacker documentary Freedom Downtime. He also appeared on ABC’s Alias as a CIA computer whiz; to play the role, Mitnick was only allowed to use prop computers. 


Kevin Poulsen 

Handle: Dark Dante 

Claim to fame: In 1990 Poulsen took over all telephone lines going into Los Angeles area radio station KIIS-FM, assuring that he would be the 102nd caller. Poulsen won a Porsche 944 S2 for his efforts. 

First encountered a computer: When his parents bought him a TRS-80 (better known as a "Trash-80"). 

Unusual tools: A set of locksmith tools he used to break into phone company trailers. He was caught after a friend commemorated the break-ins with snapshots of Poulsen picking locks. 

Little-known fact: Admitted breaking into computers to get the names of undercover businesses operated by the FBI. 

Current status: Thanks to an episode of Unsolved Mysteries, Kevin Poulsen was arrested and spent three years in prison. He was then forbidden to touch a computer for another three years. Poulsen is now a self-proclaimed "reformed and penitent" journalist, and serves as editorial director for Security Focus. 


Johan Helsingius 

Handle: Julf 

Claim to fame: Operated the world’s most popular anonymous remailer, called penet.fi, until he closed up shop in September 1996. Helsingius’ troubles started when he was raided in 1995 by the Finnish police after the Church of Scientology complained that a penet.fi customer was posting the "church’s" secrets on the Net. Helsingius mothballed the remailer after a Finnish court ruled he must reveal the customer’s real e-mail address. 

Unusual tools: Ran the world’s busiest remailer on a run-of-the mill 486 with a 200-megabyte harddrive. 

Little-known fact: Never felt the need himself to post anonymously. 

Current status: Johan Helsingius lends his cyber knowledge to communication companies worldwide. 


Vladimir Levin 

Handle: Unknown 

Claim to fame: A graduate of St. Petersburg Tekhnologichesky University, this mathematician allegedly masterminded the Russian hacker gang that tricked Citibank’s computers into spitting out $10 million. Arrested by Interpol at Heathrow Airport in 1995. 

First encountered a computer: Unknown. Accused of using his office computer at AO Saturn, a St. Petersburg, Russia, computer firm, to break into Citibank. 

Unusual tools: Along with a computer, computer games and disks, Russian police confiscated a camcorder, music speakers and a TV set from Levin’s apartment. 

Little-known fact: Levin claimed that one of the lawyers assigned to defend him was actually an FBI agent. 

Current status: Vladimir Levin fought extradition to the United States for two years, but eventually lost his case. He was sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay Citibank $240,015 (his share from the heist). Citibank has since begun using the Dynamic Encryption Card, a security system so tight that no other financial institution in the world has it. 


Steve Wozniak 

Why Woz? Because he exemplifies the young hacker’s dream. Just out of college, the two Steves (Wozniak and Jobs) set to work designing computer games (for Atari) and building blue boxes (for themselves). Woz builds the Apple I. It has no keyboard, no case, no sound or graphics, but it is a thing of beauty nonetheless. The boys shake hands on April Fools’ Day 1976, and Apple Computer is born. The pride of the Homebrew Computer Club, Wozniak trades in his HP programmable calculator and Jobs sells his VW van to finance production from a Palo Alto garage. 
Current status: Steve Wozniak continues to do work for Apple. You can learn more about him on his website, http://www.woz.org 


Tsutomu Shimomura 

To state the obvious: Shimomura outhacked and outsmarted Kevin Mitnick, the nation’s most infamous cracker/phreaker, in early 1994. After colleagues at the San Diego Supercomputing Center informed Shimomura that someone had stolen hundreds of software programs and files from his work station, the computer security expert worked on a tip to track the thief through the WELL. A labyrinthine telco trail eventually led to an apartment complex in Raleigh, N.C., where FBI agents apprehended Mitnick. (They’ve had less luck tracking down Mitnick’s alleged Israeli accomplice.) But that’s not all: A consultant to the FBI, Air Force and National Security Agency, Shimomura is rumored to have engaged in darkside dabblings himself. As Jon Littman notes, "I’ve always wondered why he wrote that program to eavesdrop on cell phone calls. Somehow it doesn’t sound like an NSA contract." 
Current status: Tsutomu Shimomura co-wrote Takedown, an account of how he trapped hacker Kevin Mitnick. He still works for San Diego Supercomputer as a research fellow. 


Linus Torvalds 

A true hacker in the classic sense, Linus Torvalds was a computer science student at the University of Helsinki when he wrote the operating system Linux (a contraction of "Linus’ Minix") in 1991. The software has proven to be tremendously popular worldwide — and best of all it’s FREE! Torvalds modestly attributes much of Linux’s success to the Net and to Richard Stallman’s GNU: Both have facilitated development of his original kernel by fostering collaboration among software programmers and developers. 
Current status: Linus Torvalds — one of the most genuinely respected hackers in history — now works for Transmeta, a company that develops software-based microprocessors. He’s married with two daughters. 


Eric Steven Raymond 

Eric Steven Raymond is the granddaddy of today’s hackers, a man who revels in living the life in all its geeky glory. According to him, "The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved." 
Annoyed by the fact that most people misuse the term "hacker," he wrote The Hacker’s Dictionary and How to Be a Hacker. (Raymond says the basic difference is that "hackers build things, crackers break them.") 

Not only is he respected for his astounding skills as a programmer, but Raymond is also valued as a fierce defender of the Open Source Movement, which is based on the premise that programmers should be able to read and modify all software source codes. In this IT paradise, programmers would be able to improve software and fix any potentially lethal bugs. Steve Wozniak would be a god. Bill Gates would be the serpent. 

In addition to programming, Raymond is also a fan of libertarianism, neo-paganism and the right to bear arms. 


Ian Murphy 

The year was 1981. The Reagan administration was in its infancy. "Elvira" was setting the Billboard charts on fire. And a young hacker was about to become the first person ever arrested for a computer crime. 
Eighteen months earlier, Ian Murphy (a.k.a. "Captain Zap") along with three cohorts, hacked into AT&T’s computers and changed their internal clocks. People suddenly received late-night discounts in the afternoon, while others who waited until midnight to use the phone were greeted with hefty bills. For his part in the crime, Murphy was greeted with 1,000 hours of community service and 2 1/2 years probation (considerably less than what fellow hackers would receive today). He also became the inspiration for the movie Sneakers. 

Today Murphy, like other hackers, runs his own security company — IAM Secure Data Systems, Inc. For $5,000 a day plus expenses, Murphy has dressed up as a phone-company employee and cracked a bank’s security system, aided a murder investigation, and conducted studies in airline terrorism. But Murphy’s great love is still hacking into company security systems — with their permission — and helping them guard against potential break-ins. 


John Perry Barlow 

John Perry Barlow is a study in contrasts. The man with the WASP-ish name was actually born in Wyoming and educated in a one-room schoolhouse. He was a cattle rancher before he dropped out and became a songwriter for an up-and-coming band called the Grateful Dead. He applied the term "cyberspace" to today’s media, and co-founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit organization devoted to preserving freedom of speech on the Internet. Barlow is a tough guy to pin down. And that might make him one of the greatest hackers of all. 
Though Barlow’s Apple PowerBook is hidden beneath Grateful Dead stickers and dancing bears, he’s still quite grounded in the 21st century. This self-described "techno-hippie" now spends his days fighting the "evil conglomerate," which includes Microsoft, AOL and even the Motion Picture Association of America, while pushing his agenda to preserve freedom of expression in cyberspace. Barlow’s greatest hope is that "we will create a civilization in the mind of cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than your governments have created." In addition, he believes that "there is something inherently liberating about getting on the Internet. There has been demonstrated a cultural infection in Internet use that is more powerful than the infections that others bring to it. And I place a great deal of faith in what’s going to happen in society when more people are online and fewer people are watching television."
